# Brand Builder

Build your own brand

## How to build a brand

Use the `q` search parameters to enter the sentence you want. 
Only characters from A to Z (lowercase or uppercase) will be included.

For example:
```
https://brandbuilder.aleryc.fr/?q=only%20a%20memory%20remains
```

In the page, you can drag and drop the tiles to customize your brand. The app will prevent you from reordering the tiles and break your sentence.

## Run the project

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Build the project

```
npm build
```

You can deploy the `dist/` folder after that.
